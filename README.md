This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Perl related to the `each` function and hash iteration.  The `each` function modifies the internal iteration state of the hash. This means that if you modify the hash while iterating (adding, deleting, or modifying entries), the iteration will not behave as expected.  The `bug.pl` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.pl` offers a corrected version.
